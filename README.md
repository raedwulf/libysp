Part of the software contains an implementation of the WFG algorithm used to
calculate exact hypervolumes.  This is included in the source code in
libysp/wfg.{c,h} in a slightly modified form to be interfaced.
The original work can be found in the github repository
[lbradstreet/WFG-hypervolume] (https://github.com/lbradstreet/WFG-hypervolume).
